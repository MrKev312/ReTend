	<description>
		Tired of your colonists being unable to work for days because of a sloppy doctor?
		With ReTend you can order your doctor to re-attempt tending an injury (or disease) until it's at a quality to your liking.
		By increasing the quality of a tend your colonists will heal quicker and gain immunity faster reducing the risk of an untimely death.
